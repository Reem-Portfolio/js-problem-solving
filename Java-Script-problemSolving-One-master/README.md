# üß† JavaScript Problem Solving ‚Äì Part 1

A collection of **beginner-to-intermediate JavaScript exercises** designed to strengthen logical thinking, problem-solving, and algorithmic skills.
Each problem focuses on using **core JavaScript concepts** like loops, conditions, arrays, strings, and objects.
Every exercise is stored in its own folder (e.g., `Problem01`, `Problem02`, etc.) so you can explore the solution directly.
