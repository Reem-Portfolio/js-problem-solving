# 🧠 JavaScript Problem Solving – Part 2

This folder contains a set of **JavaScript problem-solving exercises** designed to strengthen your understanding of loops, functions, objects, promises, and asynchronous JavaScript.  
Each question focuses on a specific concept and includes both the **problem statement** and its **solution**.

---

## 📘 Questions Overview

1. **For Loop with Continue**  
   Print numbers from 1 to 10, skipping those divisible by 3.
   
2. **While Loop – Sum of Numbers**  
   Use a `while` loop to calculate the sum from 1 to 100.

3. **Array Iteration (forEach)**  
   Print each element in an array using `forEach`.

4. **forEach vs for...of**  
   Comparison between both loops — when and how to use each.

5. **Object Destructuring**  
   Extract values from an object and return a formatted string like:  
   `"John is 25 years old"`

6. **Spread Operator**  
   Merge two arrays using the spread syntax.

7. **Rest Parameters**  
   Create a function that accepts multiple parameters and returns their sum.

8. **Primitive vs Non-Primitive Types**  
   Explanation with examples (copy by value vs copy by reference).

9. **Hoisting & Temporal Dead Zone (TDZ)**  
   Explanation of how hoisting works in JS and the TDZ concept.

10. **Closures**  
   Create a counter function that remembers how many times it’s been called.

11. **Promise – Resolve After 3 Seconds**  
   Function returns a promise that resolves after 3 seconds with `"Success"`.

12. **Async/Await Conversion**  
   Rewrite the previous example using async/await syntax.

13. **Promise with Random Number**  
   Return a promise that resolves if a random number > 5, otherwise rejects.

14. **Promise Chaining**  
   Demonstrate chaining multiple `.then()` handlers for sequential execution.

15. **Error Handling with try...catch**  
   Implement error handling in asynchronous code.
