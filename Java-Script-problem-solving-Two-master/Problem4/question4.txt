    4. Explain the difference between `forEach` and `for...of` loops in JavaScript.
    forEach:
    Works on arrays.
    Passes the element, index, and entire array as parameters to the callback.
    It doesn't break or return early from the loop

    for...of:
    Works on iterable objects (arrays, strings, maps, sets, etc.).
    Allows the use of break, continue, and return statements.
